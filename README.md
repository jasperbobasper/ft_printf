# ft_printf - Recreating printf Function

The goal of this project was to create a custom library, ft_printf(), that mimics the behavior of the original printf.

## Key Requirements:

    -Develop ft_printf without implementing buffer management like the original printf.
  
    -Handle conversions: cspdiuxX%
  
    -Output should be identical to the original printf.

This project helped me gain understanding of format specifiers, argument handling, and string formatting. It improved my data type handling, output formatting, and ensuring consistent behavior across various conversions.

## Usage: 
  - run Make to build the library
