# ft_printf - Recreating printf Function

The goal of this project was to create a custom library, ft_printf(), that mimics the behavior of the original printf.

Key Requirements:

   - Develop ft_printf without implementing buffer management like the original printf.
   - Handle conversions: cspdiuxX%
   - Output should be identical to the original printf.

This project helped me gain understanding of format specifiers, argument handling, and string formatting. I was able to improve my data type handling to ensure consistent behavior across various conversions.

## Usage: 
  - run `Make` to build the library
  - use the funtion ft_printf() as you would use the original function
  - enjoy!
